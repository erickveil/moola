moola

Moola is to be a LAMP based money management software. I'm not going to get into
all of the expansive, imaginary plans I have for this software, because it's my
own project, and I have yet to see one of my own projects (ie, not monetarily
motivated) actually complete.

So I will say the immedate goal for this project is to be able to convert a csv
format file, downloaded from my bank, into a sql table, that I will query and
display in a pretty web page as a read-only leger.

Where I go from there is subject to my free time (lol, "free time!") and
whim.
