moola

Moola is to be a LAMP based money management software. 
I have many plans for it, but we will see what I can realisticly do with limited
time.

Currently able to import a csv file into an SQL database, and query it into a
web page ledger. I'd like to build functionality on top of that.

Where I go from there is subject to my free time (lol, "free time!") and
whim.

setup:

requires a LAMP or WAMP environment.
-add files to /etc/www/html
-create mysql user moola, password is password, then create database moola
(the php is hard coded for this user/password/database for now. Will add
custom users later maybe).
-add the tables to moola:
mysql -u moola -p"password" moola < path/to/base.sql

to fill your database:
-have a csv file with accounts. Format must be:
First two lines are headders and skipped.
fields are in this order:
date,transaction ammount, check numbers, transaction type, comments
- run 
imprt.php path/to/file.csv

If your bank's csv is in a different format, you will have to modify
import.php to handle it.

to view moola, point your browser to localhost/your_directory_structure/moola.php
