Moola is to be a LAMP based money management software. 
I have many plans for it, but we will see what I can realisticly do with limited
time.

Currently able to import a csv file into an SQL database, and query it into a
web page ledger. I'd like to build functionality on top of that.

Where I go from there is subject to my free time (lol, "free time!") and
whim.
