- To start mysql:

sudo service mysqld start

-To log on as a specific user:

mysql -u username -p password

-Create a new user:

create user 'name'@'localhost' identified by 'password';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'name'@'localhost'
    with grant option;

- replace 'localhost' with % for any access, or leave as localhost for local

connection only. If use %, you also need localhost.

- create a table, must be done with default column (at least 1)

create table downloads
    (PTR int auto_increment unique primary key not null,
    DATE date,
    AMOUNT double,
    SERIAL varchar(60),
    DESCRIPTION varchar(200),
    COMMENTS varchar(200),
    SOURCE varchar(20),
    DEL varchar(20));

- to add a column to the table
    alter table downloads
    add SOURCE varchar(20);

- to add a value to an existing field
    update downloads
    set SOURCE = 'download'

SOURCE values:
SOURCE was made varchar to be human readable, at the sacrafice of possible
typo entries. Since code enters the values here, and not humans, as long as the
code is correct, the values will query correctly.

download (data is sourced from a download)
user (data entry was manually entered by a human via the interface)
edit (data entry was created during an edit of a download field)

DEL values:
like source, DEL holds string data so that it's readable in code.
Deleted entries are retained for post-mortems and recovery.

null (null in this field is not deleted)
user (user explicitly deleted the entry)
edit (deleted entry caused by an edit that takes its place)
